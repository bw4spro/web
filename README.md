# C and Computer Science: An Interactive Visual Guide

This project is an interactive, web-based guide to learning the C programming language and fundamental computer science concepts.

## Vision

The goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience where users can not only read about concepts but also see them in action and interact with them directly in the browser. C code examples are compiled to WebAssembly, allowing them to run live on the webpage.

## Getting Started

(Coming soon)
